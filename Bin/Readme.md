# Bin
In this folder you can find the windows executable of ichnos

There is also a **Dev** folder which may contain a more recently built executable. However the executable might not be fully tested.

To use the windows executable you need to download all the dlls and have them under the same folder as the ichnos.exe.

Note also that antivirus do not recognize the ichnos.exe and therefore may block the execution.
